# Predictive Analytics Competition 2018

If you participated in [Photon's PAC 2018](http://www.photon-ai.com/pac)
challenge and would like to publicly share your approach, feel free to put it
in this repo.

Why should you do that?

 - Sharing your scripts with the community will allow others to learn from your
code.
 - Seeing the code of other teams might help you to improve your own.

Don't worry if your code is buggy or doesn't look "presentable".
**Any contribution is welcomed and highly appreciated!**

Thank you for sharing and letting other's learn from your code!
